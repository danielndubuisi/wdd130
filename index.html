            <p>Hello there, my name is Daniel and I am a web developer. I love building websites and making music. Other hobbies include cooking and playing basketball. I have been blessed by the BYU Pathway program and I am grateful to heavenly Father for the opportunity to get a chance to develop my skills even more and achieve more for myself and my family. While it has been incredibly challenging, I trust in God and my ability to learn and remain resilient until I achieve all that I set out to do. <br><br> Below is a list of temples I would love to visit: </p>
